Question 1: What is the workflow for UX researchers/designers when analyzing user interviews?
Relevant quotes from interviewee:
 - "My process is I start a meeting. I record it on Zoom as well as kinda how we're doing today, and then I usually go through, I organize all my files by participant, by date. I have video recording, and then I also transcribe the audio file, so I have it in text format as well to easily be able to review."
 - "And then from there, I usually add any insights that I see either by relistening to the recording or by viewing the transcription, into a digital affinity map."
 - "I generally use Figma for that, and that's how I kind of am able to organize my findings and put them into a report that I then deliver to stakeholders."
Response: The workflow for UX researchers/designers when analyzing user interviews involves recording the interview, organizing files by participant and date, transcribing the audio for review, identifying insights, and organizing these insights into a digital affinity map using Figma. These findings are then compiled into a report for stakeholders.

Question 2: What are the pain points for UX researchers/designers when analyzing user interviews?
Relevant quotes from interviewee:
 - "I would say the transcribing is the most tedious just because be because the software I use is very imperfect. There will be a lot of mistakes."
 - "I will I would say probably 20 to 30% depending on how nitpicky I am that day."
 - "the affinity mapping does take a little bit of time, but it doesn't feel as time consuming as the pulling transcribing and pulling the findings is the most time consuming thing."
Response: The main pain points for UX researchers/designers when analyzing user interviews include the tediousness and imperfection of transcription software, which often requires significant correction, and the time-consuming nature of transcribing and pulling findings for affinity mapping.

Question 3: How have UX researchers/designers tried to solve their pain points when analyzing user interviews?
Relevant quotes from interviewee:
 - "Right now, I'm using Microsoft to transcribe. Something. You can do it easily with Word. It's not perfect, but it's still a lot better than doing by hand."
Response: To address the pain points in analyzing user interviews, UX researchers/designers have utilized transcription software like Microsoft Word, which, despite not being perfect, offers a more efficient alternative to manual transcription.

Question 4: What are the pain points for UX researchers when presenting user research results to other stakeholders?
Relevant quotes from interviewee:
 - "I I generally don't show them my affinity map. I generally put it together into a report. But, like, for time constraints, I have shown, like, if I'm seeing for example, one of our biggest, I guess, goals for the product that we're creating is bringing value and also, earning trust of users."
Response: The pain points for UX researchers when presenting user research results to other stakeholders include the challenge of effectively communicating the insights from affinity maps and the need to distill these findings into reports that align with the product's goals, such as bringing value and earning user trust.

Question 5: What are the opinions of UX researchers/designers regarding the use of AI in user research?
Relevant quotes from interviewee:
 - "AI does its best, but it doesn't have the human touch."
 - "I still prefer to go through and do it myself maybe because I don't trust the insights that it's pulling as much as I trust my own brain."
 - "But I did like that it would automatically once you uploaded the video, it automatically come create the text file and highlight things, that it thought were important to the research that would be useful for the researcher and for the team to see."
Response: UX researchers/designers have mixed opinions regarding the use of AI in user research. While they appreciate the efficiency of AI in automatically generating text files and highlighting potentially important insights, there is a preference for manual analysis due to the lack of human touch and trust in AI's ability to accurately capture and interpret nuanced insights.

Most commonly mentioned points from the interviewer:
- The workflow involves recording, transcribing, and analyzing interviews, then organizing insights into a report.
- Transcription is a significant pain point due to software imperfections.
- There's a cautious interest in AI's potential to streamline analysis, balanced by concerns over its lack of nuance and the human touch.
