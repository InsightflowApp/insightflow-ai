   - "I have video recording, and then I also transcribe the audio file, so I have it in text format as well to easily be able to review."
   - "And then from there, I usually add any insights that I see either by relistening to the recording or by viewing the transcription, into a digital affinity map."
 - Interview interview-video-2.txt:
   - "So my first step is to, like, find out which are the target users whom I should be in the week."
   - "And then, yeah, and then it's a regular interview process on Zoom."
   - "We need to do that. So as you are you are doing currently, we also record the Zoom sessions, based on the recordings, then we will, like, rewatch it, analyze it."
 - Interview interview-video-3:
   - "So before doing the interview, we had a lot of discussion, mostly mapping out the business problem and what is the user problem as well."
   - "And then after that, we invited a lot of our existing users from our platform at the time."
   - "And then we we will quickly discuss what we heard and are very cool, surprising, or stunning, and then we will record that very quickly on our notes."

 - Interview interview-video-2.txt:
   - "The analysis of the interviews is time consuming."
   - "Most time consuming? I think, rehearing the entire entire video."
 - Interview interview-video-3:
   - "I think the most time consuming is while we so we conduct the interview, and then we need to listen today again."
   - "So we need to explain what we jot down if the other person don't understand."

 - Theme 2: Imperfections in transcription software (1/3 interviews)
   - Interview interview-video-1.txt: "the software I use is very imperfect."

**Response:** UX researchers/designers face several pain points when analyzing user interviews, with the most significant being the time-consuming nature of the process. This includes both the transcription of audio recordings and the detailed analysis required to extract meaningful insights. The imperfections in transcription software add to the challenge, requiring additional time to correct errors. Additionally, the need to explain and clarify notes to other team members can further slow down the analysis process.

## Question 3: How have UX researchers/designers tried to solve their pain points when analyzing user interviews?
Relevant quotes across interviews:
 - Interview interview-video-1.txt:
   - "Right now, I'm using Microsoft to transcribe. Something. You can do it easily with Word."
   - "Sometimes I will highlight them if I wanna come back to it."
 - Interview interview-video-2.txt:
   - "We we usually just use, like, a Miro for, arranging different notes and making sense out of it."
 - Interview interview-video-3:
   - "And while we are listening, we will jot down the keywords or highlights on the sticky notes."

   - Interview interview-video-3: "And while we are listening, we will jot down the keywords or highlights on the sticky notes."

**Response:** To address the pain points encountered during the analysis of user interviews, UX researchers/designers have turned to various digital tools and strategies. These include using transcription software like Microsoft Word for more efficient transcription, despite its imperfections, and employing digital whiteboards like Miro for organizing notes and insights. Additionally, the practice of jotting down keywords or highlights on sticky notes during re-listening sessions helps in clustering and summarizing data, facilitating a more streamlined analysis process.

## Question 4: What are the pain points for UX researchers when presenting user research results to other stakeholders?
Relevant quotes across interviews:
 - Interview interview-video-1.txt:
   - "I generally don't show them my affinity map. I generally put it together into a report."

**Response:** The opinions of UX researchers/designers on the use of AI in user research are cautiously optimistic but underscored by concerns about reliability and the lack of a human touch. While AI can automate and simplify certain aspects of the research process, such as transcription and initial analysis, there is hesitation to fully trust AI-generated summaries and insights. Researchers value the depth and nuance that human analysis brings to the table, indicating a preference for a balanced approach that leverages AI for efficiency while relying on human expertise for depth of understanding.

## Key Takeaways:
- The analysis of user interviews is a time-consuming process that involves recording, transcribing, and analyzing data. Efforts to streamline this process include the use of digital tools for transcription and organization.
- Presenting user research findings to stakeholders requires simplification and effective visualization to ensure clarity and engagement.
- There is cautious optimism about the use of AI in user research, with concerns about its reliability and the potential loss of human nuance in analysis.
