Additionally, personal relationships with individuals with disabilities have contributed to a deeper understanding and consideration of accessibility needs, highlighting the importance of personal connections in shaping attitudes towards accessibility.\n\n---\n\n## Question 5: How do interactions with individuals with disabilities affect decisions to integrate usability and accessibility features into future software development projects?\n### Themes:\n - Theme 1: Increased Awareness and Consideration (4/4)\n   - P09.avi: \"I think that really opened my eyes to it.\"\n   - P08.avi: \"And so, yeah, he his his thoughts definitely added a different perspective to our application.\"\n * Interactions with individuals with disabilities have significantly increased participants' awareness and consideration of usability and accessibility features, influencing their approach to software development.\n - Theme 2: Direct Influence on Design Decisions (3/4)\n   - P10.avi: \"The auto captioning issue, like, the problems that I face with, auto captioning in YouTube videos and stuff being a lot of times wrong.\"\n   - P11.avi: \"We were brainstorming different ideas that we could bring to, you know, make sure that if you were low vision or or blind, that we would use colors, you know, that were were visible.\"\n * Direct feedback and personal experiences with accessibility issues have influenced specific design decisions, such as improving auto-captioning and considering color visibility for visual impairments.\n - Theme 3: Educational Influence (2/4)\n   - P09.avi: \"Honestly, probably that class. Probably, probably starting 44. I I honestly didn't even think about that.\"\n   - P08.avi: \"Yeah. We didn't none of our team members had that sort of disability, and so we weren't really thinking of it in terms of fonts, in terms of, like, enlarged fonts or handicap accessible properties.\"\n * Educational settings and project requirements have played a crucial role in shaping participants' decisions to integrate usability and accessibility features, highlighting the impact of academic experiences on practical application.\n\n**Response:** Interactions with individuals with disabilities have profoundly affected participants' decisions to integrate usability and accessibility features into their software development projects. These interactions have increased awareness and consideration, directly influenced design decisions, and highlighted the importance of educational experiences in shaping approaches to software development. Feedback from individuals with disabilities and academic requirements have provided valuable perspectives, leading to more inclusive and accessible software designs.\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaways:\n- There is a strong interest in technology and computers among individuals pursuing studies related to Computer Science, with motivations ranging from personal interests to pragmatic choices.\n- Coursework focusing on human-centered design and usability plays a crucial role in educating students about the importance of accessibility and usability in software development.\n- Personal experiences with disabilities, either directly or through interactions with others, significantly influence the integration of usability and accessibility features in software projects.\n- Educational settings and project-based interactions with individuals with disabilities provide valuable insights and perspectives, emphasizing the need for inclusive design.\n- Companies should prioritize accessibility and usability in their software development processes, considering the diverse needs of all users to ensure equality and inclusivity.\n"
