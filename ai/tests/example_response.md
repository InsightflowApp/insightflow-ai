   - P09.avi: "The whole point was to focus on usability aspects and different heuristics, that make using, the user experience overall better."
   - P08.avi: "The human centered design that, while there were other projects and other classes, of course, they didn't focus much on usability."
 * Courses emphasized human-centered design principles, focusing on improving the user experience through usability aspects and heuristics.
 - Theme 2: Designing for Accessibility (3/4)
   - P10.avi: "We learned, the contrast in colors on a page. That's an important factor because, people who have, visual impairments or color blindness might not be able to distinguish between certain, colors as easily as, other patterns and stuff."
   - P11.avi: "Designing things that are more easy to understand and things that, like, you automatically look at and you know what they're for and how to use them."
 * Participants learned about designing for accessibility, including considerations for visual impairments and creating intuitive designs.
 - Theme 3: Practical Application of Usability and Accessibility Concepts (2/4)
   - P10.avi: "Making systems efficient, making them easy for people to use."
   - P11.avi: "Developing new apps. We did we did do some of that too. There was an app programming for, for Ben and Jerry's."
 * Some coursework involved practical applications of usability and accessibility concepts, including projects that required developing user-friendly and accessible software.

**Response:** Coursework for participants prominently featured human-centered design and usability, with a strong emphasis on improving the user experience through various usability aspects and heuristics. Additionally, designing for accessibility was a significant focus, teaching students about considerations for visual impairments and creating intuitive designs. Practical application of these concepts was also highlighted, with projects requiring the development of user-friendly and accessible software.

## Question 3: What are the motivations for implementing usability and accessibility into their development projects?
### Themes:
 - Theme 1: Consideration of User Needs and Equality (4/4)
   - P09.avi: "So that you gotta think about who you're designing the, piece of software for."
   - P10.avi: "I would define usability as, I would define it as equality. So everyone should be on equal playing field when they are presented with a form to fill out for a website to view."
 * The primary motivation for implementing usability and accessibility is the consideration of user needs, aiming for equality in access and use for all users.
 - Theme 2: Planning and Forethought in Design (2/4)
   - P08.avi: "In the process, it needs to be thought of in advance. It needs to be planned for..."
   - P11.avi: "iPhone has customizable settings, and often, professors do, you know, kind of drill into our heads to consider what people need."
 * Participants emphasized the importance of planning and forethought in the design process to ensure usability and accessibility are adequately addressed.
 - Theme 3: Personal Experiences Influencing Design Choices (1/4)
   - P11.avi: "So, obviously, I am deaf. That's obvious. And so I often need some different accessibility, and so it was easy enough to to think about low vision as well."
 * Personal experiences with disabilities have directly influenced some participants' motivations for integrating usability and accessibility features, highlighting the impact of personal relevance on design choices.

**Response:** The motivations for implementing usability and accessibility into development projects are deeply rooted in the consideration of user needs and the pursuit of equality, ensuring that all users, regardless of their abilities, have equal access and ease of use. Planning and forethought in the design process are crucial for adequately addressing these considerations. Additionally, personal experiences with disabilities have influenced some participants' design choices, underscoring the importance of personal relevance in motivating the integration of usability and accessibility features.

## Question 4: What experiences have participants had in terms of interacting with people with disabilities?
### Themes:
 - Theme 1: Academic and Project-Based Interactions (4/4)
   - P09.avi: "I would talk to the translator, and he would sign it over to, the classmate."
   - P08.avi: "There I think we were we were required to test it through that kind of panel, the access."
 * Participants have had interactions with individuals with disabilities in academic settings and through project-based requirements, providing opportunities for direct feedback and engagement.
 - Theme 2: Daily Interactions at Educational Institutions (2/4)
   - P10.avi: "Being at RIT, there's a lot of hard of hearing students because of NTID. On the daily, we interact with, hard of hearing, and that's perfectly fine."
   - P11.avi: "So, really, anyone who would like to order ice cream, focused on the RIT students because we are focused on, and we also made sure to include folks with disabilities as well."
 * Daily interactions with individuals with disabilities at educational institutions like RIT have enriched participants' perspectives on accessibility, emphasizing its importance in software development and the broader IT field.
 - Theme 3: Personal Relationships (1/4)
   - P10.avi: "One of my friends is, a bit hard of hearing."
 * Personal relationships with individuals with disabilities have also contributed to participants' understanding and consideration of accessibility needs.

**Response:** Participants' experiences with individuals with disabilities have primarily occurred within academic and project-based settings, offering direct feedback and engagement opportunities. Daily interactions at educational institutions, particularly at RIT, have further enriched their perspectives on accessibility.
